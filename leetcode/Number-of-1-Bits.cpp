/**
*Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
*For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.
*Credits:Special thanks to @ts for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
