/**
*Write a function that add two numbers A and B. You should not use + or any arithmetic operators. 
*Example*
*Given *a=1* and *b=2* return *3*

*Note*
*There is no need to read data from standard input stream. Both parameters are given in function *aplusb*, you job is to calculate the sum and return it.*

*Challenge*
*Of course you can just return a + b to get accepted. But Can you challenge not do it like that?*

*Clarification*
*Are a and b both *32-bit* integers?*
*
*Yes.*
*
*Can I use bit operation?*
*
*Sure you can.*
*
